You may remember her as what most would consider the “token conservative” host on The View in 2014, a contestant on Dancing with The Stars that same year, and she has also starred in over fourteen - fourteen! - Hallmark Channel movies and specials in the last decade. She is also a New York Times bestselling author of five titles, the most recent of which, Kind is the new Classy, was just released.\n\nMost of those accomplishments came after a decade on hiatus from the entertainment industry. Whether you agree with her values or not - Bure is open about her Christian faith and conservative ideals - you have to admire not only her comeback, but the brand she’s built since. Her sixth book is already in the works, she just launched a line of products with DaySpring Cards, and she has over 3 million followers who hang on her every Instastory.\n\nSo how did she do it? If you’re an influencer, author, speaker, or entertainer who wants to build a massive personal brand, watch for tips on how you can build yourself into a megabrand like Bure has done.","external_id":"EybnNnZjE6qc8_bhIkSMRDlulbjEiQCQ","use_hls":true},"user":{"uid":"nfy1oy"},"image":{"poster":{"width":640,"height":360,"http_url":"/videos/fd7dc6a8493f6b1e_1243982.jpg","https_url":"/videos/fd7dc6a8493f6b1e_1243982.jpg"}},"video":{"type":"native","duration":246,"mp4":{"width":640,"height":360,"http_url":"/videos/fd7dc6a8493f6b1e.mp4","https_url":"/videos/fd7dc6a8493f6b1e.mp4"}},"livestream":false,"organization_uid":"7ba7a6","organization_name":"Entrepreneur.com","tags":[{"uid":"arx3ho","name":"comscoreAnalyticsJSON","value":"{\"c1\": 1, \"c2\": \"9564200\", \"c3\": \"Tout\"}","description":"Comscore streaming tag config - Entrepreneur","created_by":"will","created_at":"2018-03-13T13:52:45.000-07:00","updated_at":"2018-03-13T13:52:45.000-07:00"}],"local_or_national":"unknown","load_source":"feed"},{"uid":"bp1y1m","text":"Google Moves Away From Passwords and Towards Facial Recognition. 3 Things to Know Today.","grapeshot_segments":"tout_error_no_results:100.0","published_at":"2018-05-31T22:23:29Z","extras":{"categories":[{"value":"News","tag_name":"media:category"}],"publication_date":"2018-05-31T22:23:29Z","author":"","description":"Stay in the know in 60 seconds.\n\nhttps://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314332","external_id":"thZGlnZjE6uFuCkbZZ3u7DGQD2U9LOTT","use_hls":true},"user":{"uid":"nfy1oy"},"image":{"poster":{"width":640,"height":360,"http_url":"/videos/0.jpg","https_url":"/videos/0.jpg"}},"video":{"type":"native","duration":53,"mp4":{"width":640,"height":360,"http_url":"/videos/8c12ed890a58697d.mp4","https_url":"/videos/8c12ed890a58697d.mp4"}},"livestream":false,"organization_uid":"7ba7a6","organization_name":"Entrepreneur.com","tags":[{"uid":"arx3ho","name":"comscoreAnalyticsJSON","value":"{\"c1\": 1, \"c2\": \"9564200\", \"c3\": \"Tout\"}","description":"Comscore streaming tag config - Entrepreneur","created_by":"will","created_at":"2018-03-13T13:52:45.000-07:00","updated_at":"2018-03-13T13:52:45.000-07:00"}],"local_or_national":"unknown","load_source":"feed"},{"uid":"c1tcbg","text":"The ABCs of Self Defense","grapeshot_segments":"tout_error_no_results:100.0","published_at":"2018-05-31T16:02:40Z","extras":{"categories":[{"value":"How To","tag_name":"media:category"}],"publication_date":"2018-05-31T16:02:40Z","author":"","description":"Self-defense expert Jennifer Cassetta shares how to protect yourself no matter where you are.","external_id":"Mxd2VnZjE6QOMWxisaIvPbiufkjLdp6K","use_hls":true},"user":{"uid":"nfy1oy"},"image":{"poster":{"width":640,"height":360,"http_url":"/videos/8d187bd3afb1b70d_1243349.jpg","https_url":"/videos/8d187bd3afb1b70d_1243349.jpg"}},"video":{"type":"native","duration":206,"mp4":{"width":640,"height":360,"http_url":"/videos/8d187bd3afb1b70d.mp4","https_url":"/videos/8d187bd3afb1b70d.mp4"}},"livestream":false,"organization_uid":"7ba7a6","organization_name":"Entrepreneur.com","tags":[{"uid":"arx3ho","name":"comscoreAnalyticsJSON","value":"{\"c1\": 1, \"c2\": \"9564200\", \"c3\": \"Tout\"}","description":"Comscore streaming tag config - Entrepreneur","created_by":"will","created_at":"2018-03-13T13:52:45.000-07:00","updated_at":"2018-03-13T13:52:45.000-07:00"}],"local_or_national":"unknown","load_source":"feed"},{"uid":"cpsv97","text":"How Gabrielle Martinez Grew AgencyEA from Boutique Agency to Marketing Partner for Global Brands","grapeshot_segments":"tout_error_no_results:100.0","published_at":"2018-05-31T14:30:41Z","extras":{"categories":[{"value":"Growth Strategies","tag_name":"media:category"},{"value":"Starting a Business","tag_name":"media:category"}],"publication_date":"2018-05-31T14:30:41Z","author":"","description":"Gabrielle Martinez was raised in Dallas and exposed at an early age to small-business ownership.
